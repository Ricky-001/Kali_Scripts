This directory contains the Resources used/ can be used to disguise the Reverse Shell payload

[*] Contains icons that can be used as the payload icon
[*] Contains a PDF and a PNG file, either of which can be used as the main resource
behind which the payload hides

[!!] By default, the image icon is placed in the payload along with the PNG resource,
when compiled using the Reverse_Shell.sh script from the parent directory
as directed in the README_FIRST.txt and README_AUTOMATIC.txt
